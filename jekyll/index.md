## Welcome

Increasing class synergy and the prevalence of proc-based combat modifiers have eroded the accuracy of traditional
calculators that rely upon closed-form approximations to model very complex mechanics. The goal of this simulator is
to close the accuracy gap while maintaining a performance level high enough to calculate relative stat weights to aid
gear selection.

The primary purpose of this site is to host sample analysis generated by SimulationCraft. This provides players with
easy access to simulation results at various gear points and patch levels.

It is important that information flow in both directions. After examining the reports, players may detect
**inconsistencies** with their experiences in-game. In addition, <b>inefficiencies</b> (talents, gear,
gems, enchants) may be found in the supplied profiles. <b>Please</b> take the time to open an
[**issue**](https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc/issues). We are continuously looking for new profiles,
both at the normal and heroic levels.

If you need help on running SimulationCraft, developing custom actions lists, or have other questions, please see our
[extensive documentation](https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc/wiki/StartersGuide) or check out our [Github project page](https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc).
